&lt;p&gt;Ah, anger, such sweetness coursing through the veins.  No better a time to write down your thoughts than in the unforgiving, irrational haze of rage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I made my first call to 911 today.  It was by no means all that important, but I'm given to the impression that it's a good way to get in touch with police dispatch.  I felt that the police should know that the traffic lights at De Anza and Highway 280 were out of order, flashing red, at possibly the worst time possible: rush hour.  To avoid trouble, it would be prudent to dispatch officers to direct traffic until the problem was solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not call lightly.  After I had driven through the mess and it showed no sign of abating, I thought for a few moments about whether it would be worth tying up the emergency response line for something like this.  I figured that almost nobody else was going to; I learned that one in my psychology class: dissolution of social responsibility.  Given the circumstances, I figured that an accident was probable.   I've never called 911 before, so I also figured that I should overcome my fear of the whole process.  What probably tipped the scales though is that today is September Eleventh, and I'm a sucker for irony, particularly when numbers are involved.  Here follows (annotated) my conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dispatch:&lt;/b&gt; S*** *lara ***Emergency*** ********. (cell phone issues)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kris:&lt;/b&gt; I'm sorry?&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dispatch:&lt;/b&gt; You called 911 emergency.  Do you have an emergency?&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sarcastic Kris:&lt;/b&gt; No, I'm just lonely and nobody else answers my calls.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Real Kris:&lt;/b&gt; Ah, yes.  The lights at De Anza and 280 are flashing red and traffic's highly backed up.  We need officers directing traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dispatch:&lt;/b&gt; That's the Sheriff's Department.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Angry Kris:&lt;/b&gt; You are a police dispatcher, right?&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dispatch:&lt;/b&gt; It's rush hour.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Angry Kris:&lt;/b&gt; This I can see.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dispatch:&lt;/b&gt; You treat a flashing red like a stop-sign.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Angry Kris:&lt;/b&gt; Yes, yes.  I'm not a pedestrian.  I earned the right to pilot this explosives-propelled-two-ton-brick-of-death by passing the twenty question multiple choice test just like everyone else out here.  The problem isn't a matter of understanding what I need to do.  I got &lt;i&gt;through&lt;/i&gt; the intersection some time ago.  Don't assume that I'm a whiny punk stuck in traffic crying for help.  I'm trying to help here.  The problem is throughput.  There are stop-lights here because stop-signs don't have enough throughput to support this kind of traffic.  The stop-lights are broken.  We need uniformed officers to direct traffic because they can emulate the throughput of a stop-light until they're fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dispatch:&lt;/b&gt; As long as everyone obeys the law, there will be no problems.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Angry Kris:&lt;/b&gt; One would think that you, more than any person in the world, would appreciate how dreadfully naive that statement is.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Real Kris:&lt;/b&gt; Alright, thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Angry Kris:&lt;/b&gt; I'm going to hang up now because giving you a piece of my mind is not what this phone line is for and I don't want to keep you from your fiddle practice.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dispatch (suddenly cheerful):&lt;/b&gt; You're welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
