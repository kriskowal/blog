1>Blogosphere

When I moved my blog over to <a href="http://askawizard.blogspot.com">askawizard.blogspot.com</a>, the quickest and easiest way to give my page a unique look was to make my own banner graphic.  I decided to make a depiction of the "blogosphere" as I envisioned it based on the mimetically virulent <a href="http://xkcd.com/239/">xkcd 239</a>.  Randal Munroe stakes claim to a literal interpretation of the popular term "blogosphere": a layer of the atmosphere where free speech enthusiasts convene aboard various flying platforms and hawk their ideas in a sort of aerial or ethereal bazaar.

According to <tt>xkcd</tt>, <a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a> from the <a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a> is the only blogger who actually wears a cape and goggles.  I caught a certain implication that he's the only person crazy enough to dress up when they passionately jotcast.  This is not true.  I put on my robe and wizard hat.  Don't take that the wrong way.

So, I drew a <a href="http://cixar.com/~kris.kowal/ask-a-wizard.gif">depiction of the blogosphere</a>.  Over the last few weeks, I've taken some time to characterize more of my web neighborhood.

    <a href="http://onecreativeblog.com">Ryan</a> and I are in the foreground in the guises we took for our web comic, <a href="http://punnished.com">Punnished</a>.
    Cory Doctorow occupies his <a href="http://xkcd.com/497/">ironclad</a> balloon on the opposite side of the scene.  <tt>(?:T)?ron</tt> Paul lurks behind in his blimp.
    Like the wizards and witches of Harry Potter, in this metaphysical representation of the web, microblogging is facilitated by sending flocks of <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> bird messengers from balloon to balloon.  I called out <a href="http://blog.joshlewis.org">Josh Lewis</a>, a prolific blogger in my network, by putting him and his family in a balloon the same <i>initial</i> color as his old blog, emanating a halo of tweety birds.
    <a href="http://arstechnica.com">Ars Technica</a> is heralded as one of the largest "blogs" on the Internet.  My long-time MUD project partner and friend, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/authors.ars/segphault">Ryan Paul</a> edits the Ars <i>Open Ended</i> journal.  While the blogosphere is not quite high enough to qualify as "orbital" in the sense of Ars's purported "Orbital HQ", I decided to put Ryan in a nearby balloon emblazoned with a likeness of the Ars logo.  Ryan is wearing a cloak of Roman imperial purple.
    One of the earliest bloggers, <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/">Peter-Paul Koch</a> flies in the dark-blue Quirksmode balloon, from which he provides a steady hail of browser compatibility tables.
    Zeppelin enthusiast, <a href="http://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willson</a>, flies a <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> themed zeppelin.  He is trailed by the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-pony/">mimetically</a> <a href="http://hackety.org/2008/09/15/documentsRevealDjangoPonyTailOfLies.html">unstoppable</a> <a href="http://avalonstar.com/blog/2008/sep/9/web-framework-ponies/">Django Pony</a>.
    A man I believe saved JavaScript from horrible doom, <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Doug Crockford</a> occupies a balloon in his blog's colors.
    As a nod to all the fabulous people who participated in <a href="http://twitter.com/wotw2">#wotw2</a>, a Martian Unpowered Inter-planetary Attack Cannister falls through the scene on the left.

I've posted an <a href="http://cixar.com/~kris.kowal/ask-a-wizard-who.png">annotated version</a> of the current banner as a larger image, including a version in the original <a href="http://cixar.com/~kris/ask-a-wizard.svg">Scalable Vector Graphics format</a>, wherein the annotations are a hidden layer.

I plan to add to the scene every once in a while.
