1>Reading Update

I'm now reading "The Redemption of Althalus", by David and Leigh Eddings.  The first two parts make it worth reading.  I'm a bit more than half way finished and it looks like the body of the text is going to be entirely pedantic dialogue comparable to the filler for Robert Jordan's interminable series.  I miss the furtive character from the beginning of the book, greatly.
