1> Far Off

We all know I'm a little bit "out there", but where exactly I am, not many people visit, and fewer reside.

So, go to deep left field, then just walk away from home base until you find yourself somewhere completely different.  Yell, "I seek Ainalda, the blue wizard who authors the codicies!"  A flying saucer might not pick you up.  Otherwise, they'll drop you off on a continent occupied by the elves and the angles.  Go to a restaurant on an island in the large harbor between the mountains.  An ancient mariner will notice you and offer you a bunk and a job at an oarport.  Debark on an island with a single mountain, and a white tower on its southern exposure.  You won't find me there, but I hear it's really nice.
