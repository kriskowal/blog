&lt;p&gt;Ryan Paul and I have been working on Swil graphics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol type=1&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://cixar.com/swl/doc/swl.gif"&gt;The original SWL logo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://cixar.com/graphics/swilly-536.png"&gt;Ryan Paul's excellent shaded version.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://cixar.com/graphics/src/swilly-3.png"&gt;A vector rendition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://cixar.com/graphics/src/swilly-2.png"&gt;A simplified graphic.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created [1] for SWL 2.  I sketched the image on a 3x5 note card and scanned it.  Dan Restuccio and I processed the image in Adobe Illustrator and produced a vectorized version and filled the cells with solid colors.  This appears in the SWL 2 documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan Paul has been studying how to use &lt;a href="http://cixar.com//www.inkscape.org"&gt;Inkscape&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful graphics editor for Linux, to produce high-quality, cell-shaded images.  His first attempt was on his personal, lambda-penguin logo.  Ryan produced [2] with this technique, applying cell shading techniques to the cells of [1].  Ryan chose to use an obnoxious yellow for the tie to &lt;b&gt;fabulous&lt;/b&gt; effect, &lt;a href="http://cixar.com//www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=imho"&gt;IMHO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan and I collected comments on the new logo.  A friend of his, used the theme to produce their first Inkscape image.  Although his choice of color for the pig would "&lt;a href="http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=420"&gt;cause glaucoma at twenty paces&lt;/a&gt;", he did get a few things right that I didn't in my sketch.  For one, he made the coffee cup look like a coffee cup.  Mine turned out more like a gravy saucer.  He also chose white for the cup and put spots on the tie, which Ryan Paul and I thoroughly approved of.  The spots, in my imagination, are bubbles from the &lt;a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=swill"&gt;swill&lt;/a&gt;.  Ryan Witt thought it would look better with glasses and a pocket protector, to go with his tie-clip.  My coworker, Meshaal, suggested that it wasn't abstract or simplified enough to scale to icon size or be representative as a logo.  Also, Trevor Bortins suggested that, since I pointed out that the swill cup is a &lt;a href="http://cixar.com//java.sun.com"&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; parody, I should somehow work the "steam" motif in, since that's the most prominent feature of their mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recreated the logo with vectors to produce [3].  In this version, I integrated the white &lt;i&gt;cup&lt;/i&gt;, the glasses, the yellow tie, and spots.  I think I might attempt to render "steam" in the tie next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rendition [4] is for Meshaal.  The pig is ridiculously iconified into a largely circular composition, between the pig and the cup.  This rendition doesn't have the wide support of [3], but it has its adorable merits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made icons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol type=1&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="http://cixar.com/graphics/swil-icon.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="http://cixar.com/graphics/moo-icon.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="http://cixar.com/graphics/moosh-icon.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="http://cixar.com/graphics/moot-icon.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="http://cixar.com/graphics/moot-icon-1.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="http://cixar.com/graphics/moot-icon-2.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SWL used a snout icon extracted from the first logo.  I generalized the notion of the snout abstraction, since, so all of our icons bear the theme.  [1] is the decided Swil 3 icon.  [2] is the Moosh icon, already in use for the Moosh Firefox extension, &lt;a href="http://cixar.com/moosh"&gt;/moosh&lt;/a&gt;.  [4] is Ryan Paul's idea for the Moot icon.  The yin yang motif conveys the sense of disperate people interacting to produce a cohesive whole.  [5] and [6] were my original attempts to convey a "meeting" of cow snouts and a &lt;tt&gt;diff&lt;/tt&gt; of a cow snout.  We're running with the yin yang, but I'm still trying to find an idea for the icon that is less tenuous than these.&lt;/p&gt;
