It's also worth noting that I've commissioned Chris Pasillas, a friend from Cal Poly who studied Computer Engineering before getting his degree in Music with piano performance and composition.  Chris drafted at least one sketch for each of the faces of the < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/TaleWorld "Tale World" > this week.  The < http://cixar.com/tale/music/pasillas sketches > are in the Tale < https://cixar.com/svns/tale/music "Subversion repository" >.  Each sketch is denoted by a number and a name for each face and tension level.  Tension levels include "town", "adventure", and "battle".  He's also working on a motif for each face.  Please send us your comments and suggestions.
