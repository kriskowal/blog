1>Pretty Horses

I wasn't planning to make horse graphics for Tale.  In face, I was decidedly planning to avoid making horse graphics.  This isn't so much malice toward the "ooh, pretty horses" crowd, but  a conscious decision to make the world as odd and ridiculous as possible.  Well, in order to construct a certain pun, I needed the accoutrements of a horse.  So, now we have horses.  I've also added some layers for aquatic mounts.  I've also, as promised, begun testing and integrating the rider into the mount graphics.  Here are samples.
