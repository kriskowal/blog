&lt;p&gt;For the record, the name &lt;i&gt;Cixar&lt;/i&gt; doesn't, in itself, mean anything.  Rather, the name is an attempt to draw multiple parallels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts with my moniker, Cowbert.  Actually, it starts with my lack of a monicker.  My sister, &lt;a href="http://kathleenkowal.com"&gt;Kathy&lt;/a&gt;, has always had a "theme" for each phase she's passed through, albeit pandas, kiwis, or elephants.  I, on the other hand, until the age of seventeen, was as stolid as a cow.  Kathy meant to break this mould.  She gave me &lt;a href="http://cixar.com/~kris.kowal/sam.gif"&gt;a plush cow&lt;/a&gt; she earned for selling recipe books as my 18th birthday present.  At the time, I read Dilbert quite heavily, and was planning to make a parody.  Scott Adams claims in &lt;a href="http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=the%20dilbert%20future&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wf"&gt;The Dilbert Future&lt;/a&gt; that his idea of originality is reading Garfield and changing all the jokes so they fit Dogbert.  So, I made a &lt;a href="http://vonmoo.com/feature/comic/1/"&gt;Cowbert comic&lt;/a&gt; wherein I bore a striking resemblance to a particular, cube-headed, plush cow.  To clinch it, 
            &lt;script language=javascript&gt;
	      var left = [ '&amp;#116', '&amp;#114', '&amp;#101', '&amp;#98', '&amp;#119', '&amp;#111', '&amp;#99' ].reverse().join("");
	      var right = [ '&amp;#109', '&amp;#111', '&amp;#99', '&amp;#46', '&amp;#108', '&amp;#105', '&amp;#97', '&amp;#109', '&amp;#116', '&amp;#111', '&amp;#104' ].reverse().join("");
              document.write( "&lt;a href='mailto:" + left + '&amp;#64' + right + "'&gt;" );
              document.write( left + '&amp;#64' + right );
              document.write( "&lt;/a&gt;" );
            &lt;/script&gt;
           was still available.  So, these long years later, I am Baron Cowbert von&amp;nbsp;Moo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, &lt;a href="http://cixar.com/~segphault"&gt;Ryan Paul&lt;/a&gt; and I were throwing together ideas for a new &lt;a href="http://cixar.com//mudconnector.com"&gt;MUD&lt;/a&gt;, we were attributing IdealMUD, since we weren't ready to rule out any particular set of features for practical purposes yet.  Quickly, the term "Cix" filled the analogous role for a collection of "Cowix" operating system ideas.  &lt;a href="http://cixar.com//burntorange.caltech.edu"&gt;Ryan Witt&lt;/a&gt; posited that "Cix" inherently "Cix OS", especially in a British accent.  Cix has since evolved into &lt;a href="http://cixar.com/moot"&gt;a pile of ideas&lt;/a&gt;, not so much for an operating system, but for an internally consistent platform.  Of course, it isn't internally consistent, but we plan to build Gnomebots to sort it all out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of those ideas included "graphical command line" names for applications.  Taking a page from Latin, the names were inflected.  Each application had a three letter root representing the type of data it operated on.  This base corresponded to the file extension.  Then each application had a suffix of "or" for "edit-ors", "er" for "view-ers", and "ing" for daemons, a.k.a, services.  For example; &lt;tt&gt;*.tex&lt;/tt&gt; text files edited with &lt;tt&gt;texor&lt;/tt&gt;, viewed with &lt;tt&gt;texer&lt;/tt&gt;; &lt;tt&gt;*.pix&lt;/tt&gt; picture files edited with &lt;tt&gt;pixor&lt;/tt&gt;, viewed with &lt;tt&gt;pixer&lt;/tt&gt;; tabular data edited with &lt;tt&gt;tabor&lt;/tt&gt; and served with &lt;tt&gt;tabing&lt;/tt&gt;.  Of course there was in internal implication that Texar, Tabar, Datar, Vexar, and &lt;i&gt;Pixar&lt;/i&gt; would be fantastic names for teams, companies, or loosely governed alliances of hackers devoted to the development of these tools.  Then Ryan Witt bought &lt;tt&gt;cixar.com&lt;/tt&gt; for our eventual Internet home, sealing the name around us like &lt;a href="http://cixar.com/~segphault/blog/language/soo-1.html"&gt;soo&lt;/a&gt; many soggy carpets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, summarily, &lt;i&gt;Cixar&lt;/i&gt; is a loosely governed alliance of Cix developers.&lt;/p&gt;
