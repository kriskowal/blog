1>Swil, Senior Project Complete

As of last Wednesday, I managed to integrate all of Swil's components.  While the Swil interpreter is not ready to create web pages and PDFs, it can now interpret Swil programs.

I finished my < /~kris.kowal/bdoc/program/swil/milestone-2/@.pdf "Senior Project Paper" > today.  I would require myself to work on it for another week before turning it in, but that's not an option since the quarter ends tomorrow.  However, there is some valuable content about Swil's features in the last sections, some entertaining philosophical discussion (previously seen in my proposal for the project) in the middle, and some mostly pedantic discussion about how I wrote it in the beginning.
