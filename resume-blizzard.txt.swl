I've been crafting my resume for Blizzard Entertainment.  The original is complete, and I have a miniaturized, touched-up, <a href="/~ainalda/bdoc/resume-blizzard.jpg">digital copy</a>, with my sister's help with the scanning process.  The original was inked by hand on a 19 inch wide sheet of watercolor paper.  The enscription around the rim is in Christopher Tolkien's mode for English after his father's Elvish Tengwar.
