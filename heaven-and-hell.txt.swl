1>Heaven and Hell

Jean Tam sent me this gem from cyberspace yesterday: < http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/hell.htm >.  I would like to find the MIT answer to the question "Is Hell endothermic or exothermic".  Seems like they should all be collated in a common place.

Ryan Witt added a turret, wall, tower, and moat to the < http://cixar.com/moot/Cixtle Cixtle > yesterday.  If there is any other omen to a successful open source project suite, its when someone expands on a small idea.  Thank you, Ryan.

Ryan Paul posted his survey of < http://programming.newsforge.com/programming/05/02/24/1650248.shtml?tid=57&tid=132 "XML editors" > to News Forge.  I'm very pleased that OSNews thought it credible, usefull and pertinent to cross link the article.  I look forward to a long, literate relationship growing from these seeds we see today.
