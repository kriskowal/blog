1>Batman Begins

I saw <i>Batman Begins</i> this evening.  I was impressed.  My co-worker Meshaal's friend Brian didn't like some of the quaint dialog, but I managed to completely fail to notice it until the film was complete.  <i>Batman Begins</i> conveyed a simple but strong morality play, a first in the series as far as I recall, accented by an apt score by Hans Zimmer.

Of course, I must note that the last two movies I saw were in the Downtown Cinema and the Fremont in San Luis, both of which had appalling sound.  The Regal in Arroyo Grande's stadium seating and comparatively rich, 3d sound made this a better movie-going experience than <i>Star Wars</i>.
