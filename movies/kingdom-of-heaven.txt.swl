1>Kingdom of Heaven

Today, Tom and I abandoned our academics for a while and saw <i>Kingdom of Heaven</i>.  As I prefer experiencing movies with a bare slate in mind, I won't bother you with details, but I will say that the film has bolstered my idealism.  While I heard quivers from possible military science anachronisms from my friend, I believe that any exaggeration on mediaeval warfare only made the film more pertinent to our times: where bombs and automatic rifles replace trebuchet and archery.  More moving, however, than any feat of arms I found the spirit of engineering in this movie: "What is a man if he does not see the world and improve it."  <i>Kingdom of Heaven</i> is a story about idealism.  When you see this movie, remember your oaths, wake your conscience, and rise a Knight.
