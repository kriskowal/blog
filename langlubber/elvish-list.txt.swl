1>Elvish List

I've started an Elvish mailing list at Google Groups, < http://googlegroups.com/group/elvish >.

"A forum for J.R.R. Tolkien's Elvish languages, specifically questions, answers, corrections, and discussion, especially when prompted by beginners or passing enthusiasts. This list discusses Elvish languages with the humble pretense of authority in service of your curiosity."
