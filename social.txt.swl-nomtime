1>Social Calendar

For friends in the area, here's a link to my "social calendar".  At the moment I've just listed "(Bad)? (Movie|Game) Night", a recurring Tuesday and Thursday evening event with an open invitation; please just call if you want to join in the entertainment.  I plan to update the calendar with specific events like "Star Trek IV", "Carcassonne", or "MarioKart Tourney" based on who I know is coming.
