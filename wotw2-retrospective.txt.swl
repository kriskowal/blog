1> War of the Worlds 2.0 - The Post Mortem

Stuff's just beginning to trickle in reflecting on our Halloween reenactment of The War of the Worlds on Twitter.  Here are some links to what we've found so far.

Each participant averaged 2.6 tweets total.  The most active participants posted 60 to 100 tweets.  There were around 600 people following the invasion progress.  That's about 1500 tweets for all participants over the course of the event.  I think it's safe to assume that about 10,000 people were touched by these apocalyptic tidings.

Hopefully, we'll have a participation histogram (total tweet count for each participant) soon.  I'd like to see a timeline integrating all of the media we produced.

That was a lot of fun.  We'll have to do something similar again some time.
