1> Tale Update

I'm not exactly on schedule for < http://tale.im Tale > (I intended to have a playable alpha this month), but here's your consolation prize: art updates.

I recently added < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/FireDrake "Fire Drakes" > and ducks to the Tale managerie.  You'll encounter varous breeds of Fire Drake Elementals and Alloyals throughout the eastern face of the world, < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/Oria Oria >.  The brave and, more importantly, resilient will eventually encounter < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/FrancisDrake FrancisDrake >, the drake leader.

Additionally, those daring to travel south to < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/Austra Austra > will eventually encounter first patrols, squadrons, platoons, companies, battalions, regiments, brigades, divisions, corps, and eventually <i>hordes</i> of < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/Penguin penguins >.  The penguin collective recently added an air-force to their numbers with propellor-beanie sporting aerial grenadier penguins, < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/AeroPenguin Aero-pengins >, and ballistic-missile ground forces, < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/RocketPenguin Rocket-penguins >.

The penguins appear to be gearing up for war with < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/Borea Borea >, however, < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/MagusBorealis "the red mage of the North" > will not be caught with his snow-pants down.  The elves have recruited the not-so-friendly < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/PolerBear poler-bears > to introduce penguin to their rich baby-seal diet.  The < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/Narwhal narwhal > claims neutrality and you're not likely to find him unless you dive in the frigid < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/BorealSea "Boreal Sea" >.

Plans are under-way to populate all of the evil faces of the world with popular open-source mascots.  You can expect to see the BSD < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/Daemon Daemon > in the hell-world of < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/Dysia Dysia >, and maybe even < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/FireFox Fire-foxen > in < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/Oria Oria >.  Drop me a line if you think of an appropriate mascot for the /East, perhaps involving fire or ducks, especially if it continues the theme of rougue operating systems.

On a completely different topic, there is new art for Tale accessories including a morning-star, the < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/BrickOfPower brick-of-power >, and the < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/iTome iTome > for < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/Manic manic > fighters.  These < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/Items items > will be available on the ever-popular face 5, < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/Occia Occia >.

That gives me <s>a good</s> an idea.  Perhaps there should be an operating system for <i>every</i> face!  Faces 6, 5, and 4 (good) would be commercial operating systems while faces 1, 2, 3 (evil) would be open-source.  Face 6 will obviously be blighted with drafts; does anybody have an idea for < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/Borea Borea >, the north pole?

Also, there's a new item for your initial inventory when you start the game in Euia, a < https://cixar.com/tale/wiki/Spork spork >.
