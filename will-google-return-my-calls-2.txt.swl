1> Will Google Return My Call - Part 2

I got a response from Google regarding my internship application.
That is, I got a a box with some nifty Google < http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=swag swag > and a nice little note that didn't quite exactly not have <font color="red"/>NO</font> written on it in big friendly letters.  Well, it's a nice hat anyway.

As I wear this cap around campus, I wonder if it serves as a warning beacon to all who know what it portends.
